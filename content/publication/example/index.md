abstract: "We study a labor market in which firms, when posting a job vacancy,
  have to decide whether to post a wage (transparent) or use an auction to
  determine the wage (non- transparent). Firms are heterogeneous in their
  willingness to hire which is private informa- tion for each firm and workers
  form beliefs about it depending on transparency decisions. A firm that post a
  wage trade-off higher wages and attracting a larger amount of workers to the
  vacancy. A firm that use an auction take advantage on the uncertainty about
  the willingness to hire and the competition among workers to obtain the job.
  In equilibrium, firms prefer to post wages, regardless their willingness to
  pay and for any possible belief workers may have, which implies that the labor
  market is divided in two: firms with higher willingness to pay that offer
  higher wages, and firms with lower willingness to pay that offer lower wages."
